Welcome to the Duvitech Web project,

If this is the first time accessing the project there are a few things that 
will need to be done prior to starting development on this project.  You must
have the following installed:

-	Visual Studio 2013 Professional or higher
-	Team Foundation Server GIT Plugin

The first time opening the solution file for the Dashboard project you must go 
through and install all the 3rd party dll's required for the project which is
done through nuget.  Access nuget via the Visual Studio 2013 Menu 

TOOLS->LIBRARY PACKAGE MANAGER->PACKAGE MANAGER CONSOLE

The package manager console will open and there should be a Restore Button, 
which will install the packages for you.  Once finished you must restart 
Visual Studio and once back in the IDE, you must open the Package Manager Console
again and this time run the command to create and initialize the database for
the dashboard.

Change default startup project to: com.duvitech.web and default Package Manager Console Project to com.duvitech.domain

Configure web.config in com.duvitech.web to point to your database
Configure app.config in com.duvitech.domain to point to your database

Within Package Manager Console runt the following command to generate or update the database
update-database -force

Once this is complete the dashboard will compile and run.  The login credentials for
the admin are:

UserEmail:	admin@duvitech.com
